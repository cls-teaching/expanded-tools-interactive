## Project 1: HTML Patterns

### Description

HTML and CSS don't always have to convey information; they can be used as drawing tools in the browser. Make a series of patterns to be viewed in the browser using only HTML and CSS. Explore color, shape, regularity, hierarchy, and density in your pattern-making process. There's no requirement that your patterns be regular. Feel free to push and explore the edges of graphic form in the browser.

### Learning Outcomes

- familiarity with tagging and positioning in CSS
- familiarity with hover states in CSS
- familiarity with commenting
- the ability to make code to be used by other people
- comfort using other people's code
