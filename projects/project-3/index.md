## Project 3: (Hyper)Text

### Description

Choose a text. The text can be anything—a poem, an essay, a collection of texts from a friend—but for your sake please choose a text that's not too long. Ideally something you have the rights to. You are also welcome to use something you've written yourself.

Re-publish the text as an interactive website. Design interactions in relation to the reading experience. Your text isn't required to be legible, however, illegibility should be a reflection of the text itself or your reaction to the text.

An interactive text can be anything from an interactive journal article to a hypertext novel. If you like, the website can have a printed component. This website should be a work of graphic design. Please consider typography, form, color, and layout.
