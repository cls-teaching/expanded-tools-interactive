## Project 2: Boolean

### Description
Design and develop a website with two or more states. Create a condition or conditions that your website can meet. What does your website look like when the condition is "true"? what does your website look when the condition is "false"?

A condition can be as wide or narrow as you like. Conditions can come from user input (clicking or hovering a certain part of the site, adjusting the browser window), or less voluntary conditions like location, device being used, time of day, etc.

A successful project will:  

- have 2 or more states
- be a formally engaging work of graphic design

Don't worry about if your code is "correct" or follows best practices. It's more important that you create an interesting outcome. We will work together to figure out if your idea is reasonable in scope!
